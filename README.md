# [Clojure's javadoc](https://alephyud.github.io/clojure-javadoc/index.html?overview-summary.html)

This is the javadoc for [Clojure's source code](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/).
Apart from Clojure's public Java API, it covers the source code for
the [language's runtime](https://alephyud.github.io/clojure-javadoc/clojure/lang/RT.html),
the [compiler](https://alephyud.github.io/clojure-javadoc/clojure/lang/Compiler.html) and
the [JVM bytecode generator](https://alephyud.github.io/clojure-javadoc/clojure/asm/package-summary.html),
with links to source code locations.

It does not cover [Clojure standard library](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/clj/clojure),
 which is extensively documented on
[clojure.github.io](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html) (with links to
source code) and [ClojureDocs](https://clojuredocs.org/core-library).

This documentation was generated automatically, so it does not include the Javadoc comments that were
not already present in the source code.

## Generation
